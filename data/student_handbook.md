There is also no specific requirement on the amount of subjects that students need to retake. It really depends on the needs of the students as the amount of failed subjects may vary from one student to another.

Even though there is no specific requirement on the matter, students retaking subjects should pay attention to the maximum credits that are allowed to be taken in a certain semester (for instance in short semester students are not allowed to take more than 9 credits in which that include the obligatory subjects and the retake subjects).

In addition, please take note on the following information regarding retake class:

* **Subject’s availability**
  As the curriculum in President University is reviewed and updated in a certain period of time, it might result in a change in the prevailing curriculum. Therefore it is essential for students who wish to retake a certain subject to understand that the subjects in question may not be available in the desired time and schedule and can only be opened once the requirement of minimum students (12 people) requesting for the same subject is fulfilled. In the event that the subject(s) in question is not available or the minimum students requirement is not fulfilled for 3 semesters in a row (or more), except for University’s core subjects, students are encouraged to consult with their respective study program’s representative to obtain further information on the next steps that need to be taken (whether or not it is necessary to take other new available subject to replace the old unavailable one as it is still within the study program’s authority to determine this matter).
* **Credits**
